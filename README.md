# Practical-Test / Written Assignment


# 1. Q1 Create a test scenario which has multiple test cases for the following features:
```
1. As a user, I want to create a public gist.	
2. As a user, I want to edit an existing gist.	
3. As a user, I want to delete an existing gist.	

The test cases should include as much detail as possible.
```

# 3. Q3 Below is a public API doc listing a collection of API endpoints related to Countries. https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-all


Script test can be check here : https://github.com/DianPermana/Practical-Test/blob/main/Rest_Countries.jmx

I use JMeter to create scenario testing, and divide it into two categories of scenario tests, namely positive cases and negative cases. Json Extractor as main sampler to extract data from response end point (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}) and then store for all of the next process on other end point, so more easy for product team especially QA. if we want to change which country want to check. some end point issue especially for currency end point (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/currency/{currency}). The interesting thing about this testing is that I'm trying to create modular test scripts, so that by changing only 1 parameter, which is the country name, all endpoints can be run sequentially.

# 4. Q4 Are you familiar with Automation testing?
```
If yes, create an automation script using any framework of your choice for the below scenario:
1. Go to https://www.cermati.com/gabung
2. Enter all required fields (cover only positive cases) and register your account If no, canyou code in python or Javascript?
```

Yes, I have experience. Since the task automation is relatively simple, I opted to use JMeter as it is easier to use within a set framework. I am also accustomed to using pytest for automation, which can be viewed here: https://github.com/DianPermana/Automation-Testing-BDD
